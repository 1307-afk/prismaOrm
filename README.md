# Prisma ORM

## Install npm dependencies:

```
npm install
```

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

When `npx prisma migrate dev` is executed against a newly created database, seeding is also triggered. The seed file in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) will be executed and your database will be populated with the sample data.

### 3. Start the REST API server

```
npm run dev
```
